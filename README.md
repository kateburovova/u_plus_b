# Streamlit RAG Elasticsearch App

This Streamlit application integrates with Elasticsearch to perform vector-based searches and displays results using language models from Langchain. 
It's designed to demonstrate the capabilities of semantic search combined with the power of generative language models (so not a production solution).
